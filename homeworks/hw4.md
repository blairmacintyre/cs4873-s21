|---:|:--|
|Due Date:|March 8|
|Format:|Approximately 2 pages, double spaced, 12 pt font|
|Grading criteria:|Completeness<br>Writing<br>Insight into legal issues|

Pick one legal case in which a court ruled whether something was Fair Use. Write a short essay in which you briefly cover these things:

- Summarize the basics of the case. What is the disputed content, and who are the parties who disagree on whether it is Fair Use?
- What did the court decide? Why?
  - In your answer, analyze all four fair use criteria.
  - If one of the criteria is not relevant, please still show us that you understand the factor and state that it's not relevant.
- What are the broader implications of the case?

Cases you may choose include:
- Lenz v. Universal (the dancing baby)
- Sony v. Universal (1984)
- Another case of your choosing. It must involve Fair Use and computers. Don't pick something that's just, for example, about a song. A computer or the internet must play a key role. You may find this [list](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/cases/) helpful. (Some things on that list don't qualify.)

You only need to discuss one case.

Include a bibliography. Make sure to cite the court opinion and at least three articles about the case. Those articles may be in the popular press or blog posts. Ie, they don't need to be peer reviewed. It's OK to skim the court decision--you don't need to read the whole thing closely.

Come to section during the week of March 1st (the week before this is due) prepared to discuss your opinions.
