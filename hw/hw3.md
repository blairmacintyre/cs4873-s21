Consider this ethical dilemma:

> You have been offered a lucrative coding job writing software for a virtual reality exercise company, Get Hopin'. GH makes an exercise program where realistic avatars of trainers lead you through different programs in fanciful computer generated worlds. Their software can generate avatars with a wide variety of appearances, and a wide range of synthetic worlds (sci-fi, fantasy, past and present real-world, etc.)
>
> In their configuration and setup screens, players are in a virtual room with pictures of different trainer avatars, training worlds, and decorations. GH has asked you to write code that uses the virtual reality device eye-tracker to determine which pictures and objects attract the player's attention, and create a profile of the attributes of the trainers (gender, skin/hair/eye color, short/tall, thin/muscular/heavy, etc), worlds (realistic/fantastical, past/present/future, clean/dirty, bright/dark, etc), and objects (representing recreational activities, genres of games/movies/culture, etc) the player is most attracted to.  (Research has shown that players will involuntarily spend more time looking at visuals they find attractive or interesting, making these inferences surprisingly accurate.)
>
> GH plans to use these detailed user-preference profiles to tailor the trainers and worlds automatically to your preferences, based on their research showing people will spend more time in the system if it is populated with people, objects, and scenes that they prefer. Users are not informed that this is being done, as GH doesn't want to "ruin the magic" of the experience.
>
> Like many software companies, GH uses a click-through Terms of Service (TOS) that allows them to use data collected by the game to "improve the service", transfer data to a third party in the event of a sale of the company, and create new businesses from their data. GH representatives have mentioned their interest in licensing this data to social media and advertising companies, and because this is a paid gaming service, unique identifiable information could be associated with each profile.


Do you accept the job?

1. What would an act-utilitarian analysis suggest you do? Why?
2. What would a rule-utilitarian analysis suggest you do? Why?
3. What would a deontological analysis suggest you do? Why? Which formulation of the categorical imperative is easier to use in this situation and why?
4. What would social contract theory suggest you do? Why?
5. What would an analysis from virtue ethics suggest you do? Why?
6. Combine these different perspectives and provide a well-reasoned argument for a course of action.
7. Comment on noteworthy strengths and weaknesses of the different theories that came up in your analysis. Pick one noteworthy strength of one theory, and one weakness of a theory, and discuss.

Answer each question separately. In each answer, show us that you understand that ethical theory.
