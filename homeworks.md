There are three sorts of homework assignments beyond the weekly [quizzes](#quizzes): a series of written [homeworks](#homeworks), weekly [reading commentaries](#reading-commentaries), and a [term paper](#term-paper).

## Quizzes
Each week there will be a quiz based on the material covered that week.  The quizzes will be short, and the questions will usually be of a form that can be auto-graded on canvas (i.e., true/false, multiple choices, etc.).  The quizzes will be time limited, and due at the end of the week.

## Homeworks
_The details of each home will be in the assignment description on Canvas._

## Reading commentaries
The goal of reading commentaries are twofold: to give you an opportunity to practice (i) thinking critically about readings; and, (ii) communicating your thoughts about how to apply what you've learned in this class. The goal is not to summarize the readings.

Some examples of appropriate topics to address in a commentary are:
- connections between the readings and your own personal experiences
- why the reading does/doesn't seem important
- disagreements you might have with the asserted viewpoints
- why the reading is/isn't effective at getting its message across
- how the reading has changed your opinion or outlook on a topic

### Deliverable for Commentaries
Each week, there will be a reading commentary assignment on Canvas. You should write a commentary **for the specified assigned reading(s)**.

Each reading commentary should be a short paragraph (~4 sentences) for each reading, and **should end with a question or discussion prompt**, related to the reading, that you would like to have covered in your discussion section.  The TA will try to look through the commentaries before the discussion section.  You should be prepared to discuss your question during your discussion section, even if the reading(s) in question are not part of the planned discussion (i.e.., if there is extra time, in that case).

Commentaries are due an hour before the scheduled class time on the day the reading is scheduled to be discussed; this will be the deadline on canvas, even if the class is not synchronous/live.

### Grading
Commentaries will be graded either as a check, check-plus or check-minus, according to the following rubric:
- **Check Plus**: The commentary is very detailed and engages with the intellectual content of the reading deeply. The discussion question is compelling and relevant.
- **Check**: The commentary is sufficiently detailed and engages with the intellectual content of the reading at a moderate level. The discussion question is relevant, but lacks depth.
- **Check Minus**: The commentary is inaccurate, shallow or insufficiently detailed. The discussion question is missing and/or irrelevant.

If you only get "checks", you will end up with a 90 (9/10 on the "commentaries" part of the class grade). The more "check pluses" you get, the higher your grade. Likewise, the more "check minuses", the lower your grade.
